# ML Text Disaster Response Pipeline

# Project Overview
This project is to apply best practice of data engineering skills as a data scientist. In this project, I will apply Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

In the Project, a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. This aim to create a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that it can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

the project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. This project will show off your software skills, including your ability to create basic data pipelines and write clean, organized code!


## Project Components
1. ETL Pipeline
In a Python script, process_data.py, write a data cleaning pipeline that:

* Loads the messages and categories datasets
* Merges the two datasets
* Cleans the data
* Stores it in a SQLite database

2. ML Pipeline
In a Python script, train_classifier.py, write a machine learning pipeline that:

* Loads data from the SQLite database
* Splits the dataset into training and test sets
* Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
* Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
* Outputs results on the test set
* Exports the final model as a pickle file

3. Flask Web App
Provide a much of the flask web app for you, but feel free to add extra features depending on your knowledge of flask, html, css and javascript. For this part, you'll need to:

* Modify file paths for database and model as needed
* Add data visualizations using Plotly in the web app. One example is provided for you

# How to Run:

In the project's root directory:
* To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database:
`python3 data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
* To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves:
`python3 models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`
* To run the web app locally:
`python3 app/run.py` then go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/ or localhost:3001
